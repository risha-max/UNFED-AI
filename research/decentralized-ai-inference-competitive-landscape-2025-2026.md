## Themes (2025–2026)

- **Verification**: Shift from pure ZK/fraud proofs to practical schemes (e.g. Hyperbolic’s PoSP, Gensyn’s rollup + verification).
- **Privacy**: MPC and blind computing (Nillion), confidential computing (Flux), and privacy-aware orchestration in research (e.g. IslandRun, Fission).
- **Tokenomics**: dTAO and subnet alphas (Bittensor), IDE (io.net), ALLO fee-to-contributors (Allora), deflation (OORT).
- **Segmentation**: Training (Gensyn, Prime Intellect), inference (Bittensor, Ritual, Hyperbolic, Akash, io.net), privacy (Nillion, Sahara), full-stack/agents (Morpheus, Cuckoo).
- **Hybrid**: Together AI as centralized cloud with decentralized research; several projects use existing L1s (Solana, EVM, Cosmos) rather than standalone L1s.
